#BlacketScripts

Hella original scripts, addons, and improvements for **Blacket**.

This repo is a collection of fun, experimental, and quality-of-life scripts made to enhance the Blacket experience. Some are useful, some are stupid, some are both.

## 📦 What’s in here

- Custom UI tweaks
- Hidden / secret features
- Addons & extensions
- Client-side improvements
- Random ideas that actually worked

Everything here is **original**, written from scratch, and meant for learning, fun, or personal use.

## 🚀 Usage

Most scripts can be:
- Pasted directly into the browser console
- Used with a userscript manager (Tampermonkey / Violentmonkey)
- Injected however you normally run Blacket scripts

Each script should be self-contained unless stated otherwise.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- These scripts are **not affiliated with or endorsed by Blacket**
- Don’t be annoying, abusive, or stupid with them
- If Blacket updates and something breaks, that’s life

## 🧠 Philosophy

> If it’s funny, clever, or makes Blacket slightly better — it belongs here.

This repo favors:
- Creativity over copy-paste
- Clean, readable code
- Doing dumb ideas *correctly*
- if u have any scripts u wanna share, make a pull req
